# Apache 2800 Case Model

This is a model for the Apache 2800 waterproof protective case sold by Harbor Freight. This model is intended to be a rough stand-in for the real case in CAD modeling. I was unable to find an online model for this case anywhere for one of my projects so I created this. There are a few errors in measurements that I realized too late in the modeling to correct, most are cosmetic. If you intend to build with this model I recommend double check any important measurements

The model is provided exported as a .step file both open and closed, along with the original CAD file created with FreeCAD.
